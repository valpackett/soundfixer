![Screenshot](https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/222/222279.png?modified=1563218266)

a WebExtension that lets you fix annoying sound problems on the web (e.g. in YouTube videos): sound in one channel only, too quiet even at maximum volume, too loud even at minimum volume.

No more "[Plug your headphones only halfway into the jack](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11912213)" :D

(Unfortunately, doesn't work on all websites â€” specifically, we're not allowed to use the Web Audio API from a cross-domain `<audio>` source. Thankfully, YouTube is not cross-domain!)

(Doesn't seem to work in Chromium/Opera currently because of permission issues. Even when allowing all URLs.)
