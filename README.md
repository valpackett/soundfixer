# SoundFixer [![unlicense](https://img.shields.io/badge/un-license-green.svg?style=flat)](http://unlicense.org)

![Screenshot](screenshot.png)

A WebExtension that lets you fix annoying sound problems on the web (e.g. in YouTube videos): sound in one channel only, too quiet even at maximum volume, too loud even at minimum volume.

## Install

- [Get for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/soundfixer/)
- [Get for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/soundfixer/mbhbddecpoendcifccfckjkigbinefkg)

And ther you go. No more "[Plug your headphones only halfway into the jack](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11912213)" :D

(Unfortunately, doesn't work on all websites â€” specifically, we're not allowed to use the Web Audio API from a cross-domain `<audio>` source. Thankfully, YouTube is not cross-domain!)

(Doesn't seem to work in Chromium/Opera currently because of permission issues. Even when allowing all URLs.)
